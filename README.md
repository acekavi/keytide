## 🔐 Project Name: Keytide

### Description:

Keytide is a plug-and-play Identity and Access Management (IAM) microservice designed for modern web applications. Built with Go, gRPC, and Kafka, it provides a high-performance, scalable, and secure platform for managing authentication, authorization, and user identity.

Designed to be modular, lightweight, and easily integrable, Keytide offers a clean gRPC API surface for real-time operations and leverages Kafka for asynchronous, lossless event handling such as auditing, session revocation, and user state changes.

Whether you’re building a SaaS platform or need to offload IAM complexity from your monolith, Keytide empowers your stack with enterprise-grade access control in a cloud-native way.
